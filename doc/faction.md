# Faction progression

You should now be somewhat familiar with the process.

1. Farm Hack XP and money.
1. Join a faction.
1. Raise your reputation within the faction.
1. Unlock all (or most or some) Augmentations from the faction.
1. Accumulate sufficient funds to purchase Augmentations.
1. Upgrade the RAM and/or Cores of your `home` server.
1. Upgrade `NeuroFlux Governor` as high as possible.
1. Install Augmentations and soft reset.

You already know various ways to farm Hack XP and money. The next problem to
address is: Which other factions should you join and in which order? Early in
the game, the factions you should prioritize are: Sector-12, Netburners,
CyberSec, Tian Di Hui, and BitRunners. Then join The Syndicate, followed by
Bachman & Associates. Focus on raising enough reputation points and money to buy
Augmentations that increase your faction and company reputation multipliers.
Finally, join the remaining factions. Below is a breakdown of all factions,
together with the requirements for receiving faction invitations. The list of
Augmentations offered by each faction can be
[found here](../../data/augmentation/).

<!-- ================================================================= -->

## Early game factions

These are among some of the factions you would most likely encounter early in
the game.

1. _CyberSec._ The faction does not require you to be located in any particular
   city. Stay put in the city Sector-12. To receive an invitation from the
   faction, you must install a backdoor on the `CSEC` server. The server
   requires a minimum Hack stat between 51 and 60, inclusive, the exact Hack
   stat requirement being random for each playthrough. You must open at least 1
   port on the server before you can nuke it.
1. _Netburners._ Be in any city of the game world. The city Sector-12 is
   recommended. Your Hack stat must be at least 80. All nodes in your Hacknet
   farm must have a collective level of at least 100, a collective RAM of at
   least 8, and a collective Cores of at least 4. For example, if you have 3
   Hacknet nodes then the Level of all 3 nodes should add up to at least 100.
   One node can be at Level 50, another node can be at Level 30, and the third
   node can be at Level 21. A similar comment applies to the RAM and Cores.
1. _Shadows of Anarchy._ The only way to receive an invitation is to
   successfully infiltrate a company. You do not need to join this faction to
   progress in the game.
1. _Tian Di Hui._ You must be located in any one of these cities: Chongqing, New
   Tokyo, or Ishima. You must have at least $1m and at least 50 Hack. The
   faction has various Augmentations that boost your reputation gain within a
   faction and/or company. Furthermore, the faction has
   `Neuroreceptor Management Implant`, exclusive to the faction, that removes
   the penalty for not focusing on an action.

<!-- ================================================================= -->

## City factions

The city factions require you to travel to various cities in the game world.
Each trip costs $200k, one way only.

1. _Aevum._ You must be located in Aevum and have at least $40m. This faction
   offers the Augmentation `PCMatrix`, exclusive to the faction, which allows
   you to start with the programs `DeepscanV1.exe` and `AutoLink.exe` following
   an installation of Augmentation(s) or soft reset. The Augmentation also
   boosts your reputation gain within a faction or company. You must first
   install `PCMatrix` for the effect to take place.
1. _Chongqing._ You must be located in Chongqing and have at least $20m. The
   faction offers the Augmentation `Nuoptimal Nootropic Injector Implant`, which
   boosts your reputation gain within a company. The Augmentation is also

   faction has the Augmentation `CashRoot Starter Kit` that grants you $1m and
   the program `BruteSSH.exe` after a soft reset. To receive an invitation, you
   must be located in Sector-12 and have at least $15m.
1. _Volhaven._ You must be located in Volhaven and have at least $50m. The

## Hacking groups

The following factions have Augmentations that boost your hack-related stats.

1. _BitRunners._ You must install a backdoor on the server `run4theh111z` to
   receive an invitation. The server has a minimum Hack stat requirement between
   505 and 550, inclusive. You are required to open at least 4 ports on the
   server to be able to nuke it. This faction has an Augmentation that allows
   you to start with the programs `FTPCrack.exe` and `relaySMTP.exe` after a
   soft reset. The server `run4theh111z` is not shown if you run `scan-analyze`
   from your `home` server. It is buried deep inside the network. Finding the
   `run4theh111z` server is an example of the shortest path problem in a network
   setting. In particular, you want to find a shortest path from your `home`
   server to the `run4theh111z` server.
